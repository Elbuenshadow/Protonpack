# ProtonPack
Arduino proton pack source code, schematics, design. 

I want this to be a source for anyone to use to create their own proton pack kits for as cheap as possible and still include all the features for a rumble motor, 2 firing mechanisms, pack themes, full 28 segment bar graph, and an output for a vent kit.

Requirements
1 - Arduino Nano
1 - DFPlayer Mini (Be aware that some of the knock offs do not perform correctly)
1 - Any amplifing circuit (Currently testing an Adafruit Stereo 20W Class D Audio Amplifier - MAX9744)
1 - LED Matrix Driver (for the bar graph)
1 - 28 segment bargraph (barmeter.com, ebay is your best option)
1 - Pack of neopixels or equivalent ( Cyclotron, vent and wand LEDs)
1 - LED strip (Powercell)
1 - Adafruit Pixie or other RGB 3W LED
