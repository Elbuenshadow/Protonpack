  This Readme is currently a work in progress. # ProtonPack
Arduino proton pack source code, schematics, design. 

I want this to be a source for anyone to use to create their own proton pack kits for as cheap as possible and still include all the features for a rumble motor, 2 firing mechanisms, pack themes, full 28 segment bar graph, and an output for a vent kit.

Requirements  
1 - Arduino Nano    
1 - DFPlayer Mini (Be aware that some of the knock offs do not perform correctly, reference to the busy pin may not work)  
1 - Any amplifing circuit (Currently testing an Adafruit Stereo 20W Class D Audio Amplifier - MAX9744)  
1 - LED Matrix Driver - HT16K33 Breakout (for the bar graph)  
1 - 28 segment bargraph (barmeter.com, ebay is your best option)  
1 - Pack of neopixels or equivalent WS2812B ( Cyclotron, vent and wand LEDs)  
1 - LED strip (Powercell)  
1 - Adafruit Jewel - Wand Tip (WAs looking at the Pixie but there is a concern of its overhead requirements when working with normal WS2812B's, and they can not be chained together with WS2812B's) 
Pack of 24 awg stranded cable
